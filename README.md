# ♟️ The Process:
After exporting my account data from TikTok and YouTube Studio (with additional metadata from Google Takeout), I identified my top 20 highest‑performing and lowest‑performing videos based on views, likes, and impressions. I then compared and contrasted these posts to understand which themes, formats, and post timings drive both the strongest and weakest engagement.

- Maybe creating content that is the exact opposite to the bottom 20 may draw in better views.

# 🗳️ Lessons and Improvements:
- A Heavy Data Transformation was required for the TikTok metadata [(code used for this task)](https://gist.github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/cd9752f96a057d688058f32d2ef6fa5b)
- Both Youtube & TikTok do not deliver Video Tags as part of the metadata, so I had to go through and add this by hand.
