# ♟️ The Process:
After exporting my account data from TikTok and YouTube Studio (with additional metadata from Google Takeout), I identified my top 20 highest‑performing and lowest‑performing videos based on views, likes, and impressions. I then compared and contrasted these posts to understand which themes, formats, and post timings drive both the strongest and weakest engagement. With the aim of improving my overall content strategy, I plan to use this information to lean further into what the market responds to, and experiment with the weakest content to see whether I can achieve a sharp turnaround by doing the exact opposite of what the original content set out to do.
