# ♟️ The Process:
After exporting my account data from TikTok and YouTube Studio (with additional metadata from Google Takeout), wanted to look into what time & day of the week videos performed the best, based on views, likes, and impressions. I then compared and contrasted these posts to understand which themes, formats, and post timings drive both the strongest and weakest engagement.

# 👁️‍🗨️ Insights:
- The tags with the most reach are: #memes #fyp #gaming (these are the ones to keep)
- All other tags need to be reworked to spread content further.
- For both TikTok and YouTube, BROADLY SPEAKING: 9:30pm, 08:20pm, 01:20am and 04:14am seem to be best best times to post.
- For YouTube: Mondays between 10:40am up until 11:55am. Tuesdays around 7pm. Wednesdays around 8:15am. Thursdays around 9pm.  Fridays around 11am and 1:30pm. Saturdays around 8:15pm. Sundays around 6:45pm and 10pm.  
- For TikTok: Mondays 4:14am and around 9:30pm. Tuesdays around 3pm. Wednesdays around 20 minutes past midnight and 6:45pm. Thursdays around 10:45pm. Fridays around 1:22am. Saturdays around 12:55pm. Sundays just before 8pm.
- Tags, Descriptions, Locations and Titles do have a positive effect on posts regardless of choices, as lowest performing videos are those with litte or no entries on these.


# 🗳️ Lessons and Improvements:
- A Heavy Data Transformation [script](https://gist.github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/cd9752f96a057d688058f32d2ef6fa5b) was required for the TikTok metadata.
- Both Youtube & TikTok do not deliver Video Tags as part of the metadata, this had to be done by hand.
- The range of data is not great for analysis, I should seriously consider expanding the pool of data to the top 40 videos.
- 
- Tiktok meta data also does not deliver the amount of watches per video, thus I have leant on sum of likes to determine viewership. This is somewhat problematic, however an argument can be made due to the nature of how tiktok works as a platform a view is an indication that it has shown up on someones scroll, a like determines that they engaged with the content and liked it enough to mark it (or misclicked).
