# ♟️ The Process:
After exporting my account data from TikTok and YouTube Studio (with additional metadata from Google Takeout), wanted to look into what time & day of the week videos performed the best, based on views, likes, and impressions. I then compared and contrasted these posts to understand which themes, formats, and post timings drive both the strongest and weakest engagement.

# 👁️‍🗨️ Insights:
- 
- Tags, Descriptions, Locations and Titles do have a positive effect on posts regardless of choices.
- Granted anectdotally jumping the band wagon, selecting contemporary signifiers helps with post effectiveness. 
- 9:30pm, 08:20pm, 01:20am and 04:14am seem to be best best times to post for this genera of media.
- I have no doubts that YouTube has a massive potential for draw through Thumbnails alone

# 🗳️ Lessons and Improvements:
- A Heavy Data Transformation [script](https://gist.github.com/christophergillard9696-lgtm/cd9752f96a057d688058f32d2ef6fa5b) was required for the TikTok metadata.
- Both Youtube & TikTok do not deliver Video Tags as part of the metadata, so I had to go through and add this by hand.
